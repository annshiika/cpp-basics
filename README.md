# C Basics - First Year Learning

This repository contains my first C programs as I learn programming fundamentals in my first year of Computer Science.

## Programs included
1. **even_odd.c** - Checks if a number is even or odd
2. **hello world** - Prints hello world
3. **Calculator.c** - a simple calculator using basic airthmatic
4. **loops demo.c** - Demonstrate loops in c

## How to run
- Compile the code with `gcc even_odd.c -o even_odd`  
- Run the program: `./even_odd`  
- Enter any integer, and it will tell if it’s even or odd.

## Skills Learned
- Basic C syntax
- Input/Output (`scanf`, `printf`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Debugging simple errors
- Loops ('for' , 'while')

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation for future hackathons.
